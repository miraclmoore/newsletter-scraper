# Story 1.2: Email Forwarding Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to forward newsletters to a unique email address,
**so that** they automatically appear in my newsletter dashboard without needing OAuth permissions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Each user gets a unique forwarding email address (e.g., user123@newsletters.app)
2. System receives and processes emails sent to forwarding addresses
3. Forwarded emails are parsed and stored as newsletter items
4. User can view their unique forwarding address in settings
5. System validates that forwarded emails come from legitimate newsletter sources
6. Forwarded emails are deduplicated against existing items
7. User receives confirmation when forwarded emails are successfully processed
8. System handles email parsing errors gracefully
9. Rate limiting prevents abuse of forwarding system

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [ ] Configure SES/SendGrid for inbound email handling
  - [ ] Set up webhook endpoints to receive parsed emails

  - [ ] Extract newsletter metadata (sender, subject, date)
  - [ ] Store processed emails as newsletter items
  - [ ] Send processing confirmation to user
- [ ] Add newsletter source validation (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Implement sender whitelist/verification
  - [ ] Check for common newsletter patterns
  - [ ] Block spam and invalid senders
  - [ ] Log rejected emails for review

  - [ ] Implement IP-based rate limiting
  - [ ] Add CAPTCHA for suspicious activity
  - [ ] Monitor and alert on unusual patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1 (Gmail/Outlook OAuth):
- Database models for Users, Sources, and authentication are established
- API structure follows RESTful conventions with `/sources` endpoints
- Token encryption and security patterns are implemented
- Rate limiting middleware patterns are available

### Data Models
From architecture documents:
- **Users**: Store user account and forwarding address [Source: architecture/data-model-simplified.md]
- **Sources**: Track forwarding inbox as a source type [Source: architecture/data-model-simplified.md]
- **Items**: Store parsed newsletter content from forwarded emails [Source: architecture/data-model-simplified.md]
- **Jobs**: Track email processing status [Source: architecture/data-model-simplified.md]
- Indexes required on user_id, source_id, normalized_hash for efficient queries [Source: architecture/data-model-simplified.md]

### API Specifications
From architecture documents:
- `POST /sources` - Add forwarding inbox as source [Source: architecture/api-examples.md]
- `GET /feed` - Display processed forwarded emails [Source: architecture/api-examples.md]
- Webhook endpoints for inbound email processing (extension of existing API patterns) [Source: architecture/core-components.md]

### Component Specifications
From architecture documents:
- **Ingestion Layer**: Forwarding inbox via SES/SendGrid aliases [Source: architecture/core-components.md]
- **Parsing/Normalization**: Extract main text, remove ads, canonicalize links [Source: architecture/core-components.md]
- **Background Jobs**: Queue-based workers for ingest/parse [Source: architecture/core-components.md]
- **Storage**: Postgres (structured), S3/GCS (raw email storage) [Source: architecture/core-components.md]

### File Locations
Based on Node.js architecture and previous story patterns:
- **Email webhook routes**: `/src/routes/webhooks/email.js`
- **Email processing service**: `/src/services/email/` (parser.js, validator.js)
- **Forwarding service**: `/src/services/forwarding/addressGenerator.js`
- **Database models**: Extend `/src/models/User.js` with forwarding address field
- **Background workers**: `/src/workers/emailProcessor.js`
- **Frontend components**: `/src/components/settings/ForwardingAddress.jsx`
- **Email templates**: `/src/templates/email/` (confirmation emails)

### Technical Constraints
From architecture documents:
- **Security**: Validate sender reputation, prevent spam [Source: architecture/security-compliance.md]
- **Ingestion**: Forward-to-inbox via SES/SendGrid aliases [Source: architecture/ingestion-strategies.md]
- **Parsing**: MIME decode → select HTML part → sanitize → extract content [Source: architecture/parsing-normalization.md]
- **Performance**: Parse < 2s per email on average [Source: architecture/performance-scaling.md]
- **Deduplication**: Generate hash + fingerprint for dedupe [Source: architecture/parsing-normalization.md]

### Testing Strategy
**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- **Backend Testing**: Jest + Supertest for webhook endpoints
- **Email Testing**: Mock email provider webhooks for integration testing
- **Worker Testing**: Test background job processing with queue mocks
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library for settings components

**Required Test Coverage:**
- **Unit Tests**: Email parsing, address generation, validation logic
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end email processing pipeline, webhook handling
- **Component Tests**: Forwarding address display and management UI
- **Security Tests**: Sender validation, rate limiting, spam prevention

**Specific Test Scenarios:**
- Successful email forwarding and processing
- Email parsing with various newsletter formats
- Duplicate email detection and handling
- Invalid sender rejection
- Rate limiting enforcement
- Forwarding address generation uniqueness
- Error handling for malformed emails
- UI feedback for forwarding status

**Test File Locations:**
- **Email service tests**: `/src/services/email/__tests__/`
- **Webhook integration tests**: `/src/routes/webhooks/__tests__/email.test.js`
- **Worker tests**: `/src/workers/__tests__/emailProcessor.test.js`
- **Frontend component tests**: `/src/components/settings/__tests__/ForwardingAddress.test.jsx`
- **E2E tests**: `/tests/e2e/email-forwarding.test.js`
