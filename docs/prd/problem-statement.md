# Problem Statement
Email newsletters are valuable sources of insight, but they quickly overwhelm inboxes. Users have no simple way to:
- Aggregate multiple newsletters into one clean feed.
- Remove noise (headers, ads, duplicate content).
- Summarize content quickly for decision-making.
- Export to tools they already use (Notion, Slack, Markdown).

Existing tools (Mailbrew, Readwise, Meco) are either too broad, too expensive, or not focused on simplicity + affordability.
