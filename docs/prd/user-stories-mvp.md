# User Stories (MVP)

## Input & Integration
- As a user, I can connect Gmail/Outlook via OAuth so my newsletters are auto-imported.
- As a user, I can forward newsletters to a unique address so they appear in my dashboard.
- As a user, I can subscribe to an RSS feed (Substack, Medium) and see it in my dashboard.

## Scraping & Normalization
- As a user, I want email bodies parsed cleanly (no headers/footers/ads) so I only see content.
- As a user, I want duplicate issues removed so my feed is concise.

## Aggregation & Export
- As a user, I can see all newsletters in a web dashboard.
- As a user, I can search/filter by source.
- As a user, I can export items to Markdown, Notion, or CSV.

## AI Summarization
- As a user, I can toggle AI summaries (headline + 3 bullets) for each issue.

## Account Management
- As a user, I can sign up via email or Google.
- As a user, I can manage my connected sources in settings.
